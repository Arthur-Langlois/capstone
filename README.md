**Suicides and Entertainment in the American Youth: An Interrupted Time Series Approach**
*by Dania Abuhijleh and Arthur Langlois, Department of Mathematics, Northeastern University*

*Abstract*

This project aims at quantifying the impact of the 2017 release of Netflix’s “13 Reasons Why” on the absolute number of suicide deaths in the American youth. We will use an interrupted time series approach to quantify the impact of the series’ release. This study follows on a study by Bridge et al. in 2019 which observed a significant increase in the number of monthly suicide rates following the release of the TV show. Our study aims at auditing for the aforementioned paper’s results by estimating the counterfactual of the suicide death numbers in 2018 with other regressors than those used in the paper. Our analysis suggests that the release of the series was associated with an increase of about 3 suicides for 100,000 across all models, therefore our results are directionally consistent with Bridge et al’s findings.
