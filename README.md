Our project has two main goals
1- Automatize prediction of suicides rates in a next period (t+1) when inputed relevant data (at t = 0)
2- Understand the leading factors determining suicide rates at the country level


The first half of study will be conducted through the use of both Autoregressive Linear Models and Convolutional Neural Networks, and the second half will make use –and explore the differences- between state-of-the art Machine Learning Interpretability tools such as SHAP values, Permutation Feature Importance, and LIME. 

Our dataset will be comprised of monthly suicide rates from the WHO, as well as state-specific, time-varying variables such as internet searches for keywords suggesting suicidal ideation (gathered from Google trends), as well as the availability of mental health services, unemployment rates or education (mainly gathered from the World Bank). 

We hope our study can provide insights and guidance to policy-makers regarding future suicide rates in their respective countries, as well as informing them –and the general public – of its major determinants.
